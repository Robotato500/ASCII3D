Code:Blocks project files for a raycasting command prompt renderer
https://github.com/Robotato500/ASCII3D


I've made this repository public for my MIT portfolio, so you'll have to excuse me if the code is a bit disorganised and not well commented, but it was a private thing only I was supposed to read. If you just found this page browsing through GitHub well, I hope you find this project interesting!

I’ve been writing this program in C++ using Code:Blocks. My main resources for this project have been the articles on how to set up and handle the Windows Console in Randy Gaul’s Game Programming Blog, as well as Fabien Sanglard’s description of Wolfenstein 3D’s engine in his book "Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D", to understand how raycast renderers work and how they are implemented.

This is a work in progress, so I hope to make some advancements in the next months to end up with a playable and half-decent old school first person shooter.
